## üåâ Bridge Pattern

### Participants and Interactions
- **Abstraction**: Top-level interface for the client, has reference to Implementor object
- **Refined Abstraction**: Extends Abstraction, provides detailed control to client
- **Implementor**: Defines interface for implementation classes (primitive operations)
- **Concrete Implementor**: Provides specific implementation for Implementor interface

**Interaction**: Abstraction delegates client requests to its Implementor object, allowing independent development of both hierarchies.

### Applicability
Use when:
- You want to avoid permanent connection between abstraction and implementation
- You need to change object's implementation at runtime
- Class and implementation need to be extended through different subclasses
- Abstraction and implementation should be separated in class hierarchy

### Consequences
- ‚úÖ **Decoupled Abstraction and Implementation**: Complete separation, independent variation
- ‚úÖ **Improved Extensibility**: Both hierarchies can be extended independently
- ‚úÖ **Hides Implementation Details**: Client only interacts with Abstraction

## üé® Decorator Pattern

### Participants and Interactions
- **Component**: Interface for core object that will be decorated
- **Concrete Component**: Basic foundational object to which responsibilities are added
- **Decorator**: Abstract class holding reference to Component, conforms to Component interface
- **Concrete Decorator**: Adds new responsibilities/behavior to Component it decorates

**Interaction**: ConcreteDecorator forwards requests to wrapped Component, adding behavior before/after.

### Applicability
Use when:
- You need to add responsibilities to individual objects dynamically and transparently
- Adding new behavior through flexible composition is better than static inheritance

### Consequences
- ‚úÖ **More flexible than static inheritance**: Behavior added at runtime
- ‚úÖ **Avoids explosion of classes**: Prevents many subclasses for every combination
- ‚ùå **Can be complex to debug**: Multiple layers make debugging harder

---

## üíæ Memento Pattern

### Participants and Interactions
- **Originator**: Object whose state is being saved, creates/uses Memento
- **Memento**: Object holding snapshot of Originator's internal state (token)
- **Caretaker**: Responsible for storing/retrieving mementos without inspecting contents

**Interaction**: Originator creates Memento, passes to Caretaker for storage. Caretaker returns Memento to Originator for restoration.

### Applicability
Use when:
- Object's state needs to be saved for later restoration
- Exposing object's internal state would violate encapsulation

### Consequences
- ‚úÖ **Preserves encapsulation**: State saved externally without exposing internal structure
- ‚úÖ **Simplifies Originator**: Doesn't need to manage own history
- ‚ùå **Potentially high overhead**: Large states/many mementos consume memory

---

## üîÑ State Pattern

### Participants and Interactions
- **Context**: Maintains reference to ConcreteState, provides public interface
- **State**: Interface defining behavior for particular state
- **Concrete State**: Implements State interface, provides specific behavior for one state

**Interaction**: Context delegates requests to current ConcreteState, which handles request and can transition Context to different state.

### Applicability
Use when:
- Object's behavior depends on state and needs to change at runtime
- Operations have large multi-part conditional statements depending on object's state

### Consequences
- ‚úÖ **Localizes state-specific behavior**: All behavior for specific state isolated in own class
- ‚úÖ **Simplifies Context**: No more if/else or switch/case statements
- ‚ùå **Encourages many small classes**: Can lead to large number of classes with many states

---

## üï∞Ô∏è Observer Pattern

### Participants and Interactions
- **Subject**: Object being observed, maintains list of observers and attach/detach interface
- **Observer**: Interface for objects needing notification of subject changes
- **Concrete Subject**: Specific subject maintaining state, notifying observers of changes
- **Concrete Observer**: Specific observer notified by subject, updates own state by querying subject

**Interaction**: Concrete Subject's notify() calls update() on all attached Concrete Observer objects.

### Applicability
Use when:
- Change to one object requires changing others, unknown how many objects need changing
- Subject and Observers should be loosely coupled, varying independently

### Consequences
- ‚úÖ **Abstracts coupling**: Subject and observer not directly linked, promoting loose coupling
- ‚úÖ **Allows dynamic updates**: Observers can be added/removed at runtime
- ‚ùå **Unexpected updates**: Subject has no knowledge of what Observer will do

---

## üè¢ Facade Pattern

### Participants and Interactions
- **Facade**: Single class providing simplified, unified interface to complex subsystem
- **Subsystem classes**: Individual classes within complex subsystem performing actual work

**Interaction**: Client interacts with Facade, which delegates requests to appropriate Subsystem classes.

### Applicability
Use when:
- You need to provide simpler interface to complex subsystem
- You want to reduce coupling between clients and subsystem classes
- You want to introduce layering to system

### Consequences
- ‚úÖ **Shields clients from subsystem components**: Simplifies client code
- ‚úÖ **Promotes weak coupling**: Client only coupled to Facade
- ‚úÖ **Doesn't prevent direct access**: Clients can still access subsystem classes if needed

---

## üóÇÔ∏è Mediator Pattern

### Participants and Interactions
- **Mediator**: Defines interface for communicating with Colleague objects
- **Concrete Mediator**: Implements Mediator interface, coordinates Colleague objects
- **Colleague**: Each class knows its Mediator, communicates with it instead of other Colleagues

**Interaction**: Colleague sends message to Mediator when event occurs. Mediator decides which other Colleagues need notification and forwards message.

### Applicability
Use when:
- Set of objects communicate in complex, tightly coupled ways
- You need to encapsulate complex object interactions

### Consequences
- ‚úÖ **Reduces subclassing of Colleagues**: Loosely coupled, reusable in different contexts
- ‚úÖ **Centralizes control**: Mediator encapsulates communication logic
- ‚ùå **Can be monolithic object**: Mediator can become overly complex with many interactions

---

## üìñ Key Terminology

### Core Concepts
- **State**: Internal condition/data of object at particular moment
- **Coupling**: Degree to which one class is connected to/depends on another
  - **Tightly coupled**: Classes highly dependent, difficult to change/reuse independently
  - **Loosely coupled**: Classes independent, minimal dependencies
  - **Decoupled**: Complete separation (Bridge pattern)
- **Subsystem**: Group of classes working together for specific function
- **Dynamic binding**: Determining method to call at runtime (Decorator, State patterns)
- **Static inheritance**: Method implementation resolved at compile time
- **Permanent abstraction-implementation binding**: Direct, unchanging link between interface and implementation
- **Object responsibilities**: Specific tasks/functions object is designed to perform
- **Object behavior**: How object acts/responds to messages
- **Encapsulation boundaries**: Separation of internal state/implementation from outside world
- **Class dependencies**: When one class relies on another to function correctly
- **Reusability**: Ability to use class/component in multiple contexts
